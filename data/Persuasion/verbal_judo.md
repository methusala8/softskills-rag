# Verbal Judo Summary

About The Author:
George J. Thompson is a former police officer and a communication skills trainer.
As he shares in his own book, he is also a martial arts expert but dedicated his career to using words to get what he wanted.

### Introduction

The author says that *verbal judo* is about using and deflecting the other person’s aggression to reach your goal.

It’s the opposite of “verbal karate”, which is more likely to escalate and leave people’s feelings hurt.

Underpinning the whole idea of *verbal judo* is to treat people with dignity and respect.

## **Don’t Take Things Personally**

This is rule #1.

George J. Thompson says that if you learn *[not to take things personally](https://thepowermoves.com/the-four-agreements/#Do_Not_Take_Anything_Personally)*, you’ll already be ahead of the curve and barely need any verbal judo.

Most of interpersonal issues, indeed, are born out of ego (read *[how to rebuild your ego](https://thepowermoves.com/the-antifragile-ego/)*).

> **Say what you want but do as I say**

## **Develop Empathy** 

Empathy is the most critical skill of verbal judo, says the author.

Empathy doesn’t mean sympathizing or approving of him. It means to see through his eyes and understand.

## **3 Types of People**

The author says there are three types of people:

- Nice People (will do what you say)
- Difficult people (will push back and want to know why and what’s your authority)
- [Wimps](https://thepowermoves.com/passive-style/) (will not say anything but will resent you and breed discontent)

With difficult people, George shows early on *[what’s in it for them](https://thepowermoves.com/wiift/).*

## **Always Go for Win-Win**

Following a major tenet of the *[7 Habits of highly effective people](https://thepowermoves.com/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people/),* Thompson presents the solution he wants as a win-win for both.

For example, he would say something like:

> *“so far you have only done X. if you refuse to cooperate, you will spend the night in jail, get a criminal record and I will have to do a lot of paperwork. If you step out of the car and cooperate, we will be done in 10 minutes”.*

This is also a similar technique as presented by a former FBI agent in *[The Like Switch](https://thepowermoves.com/like-switch/).*

## **Learn to Paraphrase**

Paraphrasing is another key ingredient of effective *verbal judo.*

Paraphrasing often serves to soften the tone.
Angry people don’t really mean what they say, so when you paraphrase them and use their own words such as “always” and “on purpose” they will soften the tone themselves.

When you paraphrase never ask if they understood you: nobody will admit they didn’t.
Let them repeat.

And to paraphrase them, here’s the perfect way:

> *Let me be sure I understand what you have said* 

## **Avoid These Bad Phrases**

*Verbal Judo* has a very interesting chapter about the top phrases to avoid.

I invite you to read the book for the complete list, but here are some that struck me the most:

- What’s your problem (instead: what’s the matter, how can I help)
- Calm down
- I’m gonna do X to you (don’t warn people of impending action or they’ll get ready)
- This is the last time I say it (it’s probably not true and you’ll lose credibility)
- Because those are the rules

## Here’s Why You Need to Explain The Rules

Some rule enforcers don’t like to explain the rules.

Why Not?

Because they are being egotists.
The author says that when people refuse to explain they show they are more concerned about themselves and *[appearing dominant](https://thepowermoves.com/quiet-dominance/)* than about the other person’s well-being.

And it’s most likely to escalate.

If someone else gives you the dreaded answer “because those are the rules” you could say:

> “Could you explain to me why those rules were put in the first place. They don’t make sense to me and if I understood it would be much easier for me to comply”.

## **The 5 Steps of Verbal Judo**

The author proposes a five-step approach to the conversation:

1.  **Ask** (ethical appeal)
2. **Set context** (reasonable appeal: explain policies and rules)
3. **Present options** (reasonable appeal: what’s in it for them and what if they don’t)
4. **Confirm** (practical appeal: “can I do or say anything to make you cooperate”)
5. **Act**

When you present options, make him feel like it’s his choice (saves his face, also read *[How to Win Friends](https://thepowermoves.com/win-friends-influence-people/)*).
And flash out the stories, give details: make him feel what it’s like to choose the difficult option or the easy one.

## **The Structure of Verbal Judo: LEAPs**

The author provides 5 steps and tools to generate compliance:

1. Listen
2. Empathize
3. Ask
4. Paraphrase
5. Summarize
