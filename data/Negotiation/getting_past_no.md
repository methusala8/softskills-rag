## book :  getting past no

- Put your ego away and focus on the goal
- Listen to them first if you want to be listened to later 
- Make it easy for them to say yes and compromise
- Always (re)frame the negotiation as an attempt at finding a win-win

e summarizes them into five high-level stumbling blocks:

Your Emotional Reaction:  When facing difficult opponents it’s easy to take things personally and escalate instead of staying neutral and focused on the solution 
Their Negative Emotions: Same for the other side. The great negotiation don’t just handle their emotions, but also the other party’s emotions
Their Position: Inexperienced negotiators negotiate from positions instead of general needs and outcomes (the difference is that there are many ways of achieving a good result when you focus on needs)
Their Dissatisfaction & Skepticism:  People sometimes stick with uncooperative positions simply not to lose face or not to “lose” to you. Or because they don’t trust you and are skeptical
Their Power: If they have much more power than you have, they might focus on winning or power-bending 

henever the other party goes into positional and confrontational bargaining, you must reframe it to a more helpful win-win approach. Here’s how:

1. Ask problem-solving questions
2. Avoid questions with one-word answers. For example, if you ask “can we make an exception to the policy” it’s too easy for them to say no.
   A question like “OK, what could we do to find a way here”.

3. Ask “what if” and “what’s your advice”
   To move towards possible cooperative options for agreement.

4. The idea is that you let them move towards the issue with their proposal instead of telling them.

5. Ask “what makes that fair” 
   When they come up with a solution that is one-sided to move towards more independent standards of resolution.

Reinterpret negative behavior
Whenever you get an insult and a comment, drop the insult and only focus on the positive side of the comment.

Alternatively, you can reinterpret what they said as if they meant whatever is useful to move the negotiation along.

Blame the lawyer to gain time
If you want to gain time but don’t want to make it seem like you don’t trust them or that you are indecisive, you can say that your lawyer insists in checking contracts out… “you know how lawyers are”.
Or you can say “you put a lot of thoughts into this didn’t you” and then you add “well I’d like to do the same”, fold the proposal and put it in your briefcase.

Paraphrase their point to make them feel powerful
In the chapter on “stepping into their side” William Uryr says you must paraphrase their position.
When they can confirm or correct you, you also give them control and a feeling of control and satisfaction.

Propose alternatives for him to select
When he chooses one of your options, it becomes his idea. 
I might add here, it’s even better if you allow him to flash out that proposal.

Reality testing questions instead of threats
Instead of threatening, you can let them reach the conclusion of the nefarious consequences by asking “what do you think will happen if we don’t agree” and “what do you think we will do”.

If they still don’t bite, you can end with a statement about what the consequences will be.
For example: “I got a job offer that would help me earn more. I’d like to stay here, I enjoy working with you, what should I do… “

Use force to instruct and teach, not to punish
When you punish someone, you increase the chances of escalations, mutually destructive behavior and lose-lose.

Instead, if you must use force, do in a way that it won’t destroy your relationship.

Your goal is to show that not agreeing is the worst solution for them than agreeing.

Always remember to provide them a way to save face when they go back to the negotiation table (also read: how to make friends and influence people).

Bring them to their senses, not to their knees
