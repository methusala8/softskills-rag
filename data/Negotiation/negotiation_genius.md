BATNA is an acronym first seen in “Getting to YES“, and stands for “best alternatives to negotiated agreements”.

In practical terms, it means that you know your other options and know their value. 

When you know the value of your other options, you will know what you can and cannot concede and you will know when it’s time to walk away.

Your question is: “what will I do if this negotiation ends with no deal”.

Calculate your reservation value (RV)
This is your walkaway point, the lowest offer you can accept.
Once you are below your RV, you’re better off with no deal.

Calculate the other party’s reservation value
This is not easy, but you want to have an idea about what’s the reservation value of your negotiation partner.

Assess other party’s BATNA
This will tell you how far you can push and when your opponent is likely to walk away.

Here is a great tip: focus on the other party’s BATNA asking “what will they do without me”. 
People who focus on the value they bring to the table tend to get much better deals.

Evaluate the ZOPA 
ZOPA stands for “zone of possible agreement”.

The ZOPA expands between the buyer and seller reservation value, and within the ZOP a deal benefits both parties.

This is the pie you are going to split, and knowing all this information will allow you to properly negotiate and to know when you’re getting a bad deal, a good deal or a great deal.

What do you do if they make the first offer and it’s too high?
Don’t discuss it and don’t let them defend it because you increase its power. Ignore it or make another anchoring counter-offer instead.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Negative frame (what they stand to lose) is more persuasive than positive frame (what they can gain), but you must use it careful or it’s annoying 
Aggregate the bad news and chunk-up the good ones (ie.: break up your concessions)
Make token unilateral concessions: a bit of a power move, this one is designed to build trust and invite them to do the same through actions instead of words

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Door in the face (aim for rejection, then moderate your demand): the yes ladder is only partially true and having the other party say no, then lowering your offer can be a powerful tool to induce acceptance of your second concession
Foot in the door (aim for compliance, then increase demand): ask for a a smaller favor they can say yes to, then ask for a similar one but bigger (their tendency is to confirm their ongoing commitment to the cause)
