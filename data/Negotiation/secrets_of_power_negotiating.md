# Secrets of power negotiation



1. Ask for More Than You Expect
   1. You never know he might be willing to give it
   2. You will seem more cooperative when you will make larger concessions
2. Never Say Yes to First Offer
   1. I didn’t do as good as I could have” and he’s not happy with the result
   2. “there must be something wrong”
3. Flinch At Their First Offer
   1. When you don’t flinch and take the first offer seriously, then the seller (or buyer) will feel legitimized by their first offer and will try to defend it.
4. Avoid Confrontation
5. Be Reluctant
   1. If you look eager, you show a weak hand and the other party will feel like they can do better.
      Show yourself reluctant, instead, like you’re not sure, like they need to push you and cajole a bit more.
      Playing reluctant at the beginning is a great way to lower their demands before the negotiation even starts
6. The Vise : You’ll have to do better than that
7. Higher Authority  :
   1. Play good guy (you) and assign the bad guy to the higher authority
   2. Ask for tough concessions without seeming nasty (higher authority requirements)
8. Get Counter-Concessions Right Away
9. Never Offer to Split the Difference
   1. for meet in the middle : Oh, you mean like you could go down (or up) at X? Let me talk to my partners and see what they think.
10. Overcoming Impasses :
    1. When you’re facing an impasse, put the big issue aside and deal with the other small ones. That will allow you to rebuild momentum.
11. Good Guy / Bad Guy
12. Nibbling :
    1. At the end of the negotiation, when the tension is releasing, try to have another go at something you couldn’t get earlier. Or add something new.
    2. Negotiate all details in advance
    3. Make the other party feel like they won
13. Taper Your Concessions
14. Never Give Your Bottom Line Up Front
15. Withdrawing the Offer 
16. Make The Other Feel Good
17. Cherry Picking
    1. shopping around for options, then going go your favorite provider and try to make him match his competitors on their favorable terms.
18. Time Pressure : 80% of the concessions happen in the last 20% of the allotted time
19. Walk Away Power : But don’t threaten to walk away abruptly, make it under the protection of good guy/bad guy.
20. Don’t Use “Take It or Leave It” : It’s annoying and cantankerous. Use instead something like “sorry, but less than this I will have to drop out”.
21. Don't be intimidated by title
22. never think you have a weak hand
