### shadow negotiation

#### using threats

- If you use a threat, it must be real, and you must be prepared to follow through
- Better than a stand-alone threat, couple it with a conciliatory move: for example, you can say what you will be forced to do if your fair demands are not met
- Better than threats, talk about other options you have: letting the other party know you have other options is equally effective, and carry fewer risks of retaliation and/or of ruining the relationship

Many negotiations start out with opposing sides squared off. When you connect with the other person, you alter this dynamic.

### Ideas on negotiation

Believe it’s possible to negotiate, seek opportunities: To even think about negotiation, you first have to realize it’s possible. Otherwise, opportunities for negotiation go wasted
Look at your strengths and the value you bring to the table: Don't look at your weakness; 
Let your negotiating partner work to whittle you down, don’t do it yourself: people second-guess themselves before going into the negotiation and start decreasing their own demands before their negotiation partner does it for them
Think how to make your requests more palatable, rather than scrapping them


### Negotiating styles

Advocacy: pushing for what you need. When you’re dealing with one-ff negotiation and single items, like selling/buying cars and houses, it will be more about advocacy
Connection: the relationship side of the negotiation. You will use it more for repeated interaction and for complex negotiations. When negotiation is defined as a search for joint gains, connective skills become more important.
