# Influence & Communication Skills Knowledgebase (with RAG System)

------

This repository holds a personal knowledge baseâ€”a collection of articles diving deep into **influence, persuasion, negotiation, charisma, and emotional intelligence**. But it's more than just a set of articles; this project also features a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** built on top of this content. It's designed to show how AI can intelligently pull information and generate responses directly from a specialized dataset.

------

## What This Project Is About

This project has two main objectives:

1. To gather and organize key concepts and practical strategies for ethical and effective influence. Think of it as a growing guide for better communication and interaction.
2. To demonstrate the implementation of a **RAG pipeline**. This highlights skills in natural language processing (NLP), using **vector databases**, and building practical AI applications that can make information interactive.

------

## What's Inside

You'll find articles grouped into these main areas:

- **Persuasion:** Covering core principles and classic models of how influence works.
- **Negotiation:** Exploring strategies for effective discussions and reaching agreements.
- **Charisma:** Breaking down the elements that make people magnetic and inspiring.
- **Emotional Intelligence:** Understanding and managing emotions for improved interactions.

Each article includes important **metadata** (like its title, category, and keywords) at the very top, formatted using YAML front matter. This metadata is crucial for the RAG system to accurately index and retrieve the right information.

------

## How to Explore It

You can browse all the articles directly by navigating through their respective folders. They're all in Markdown (`.md`) format, making them easy to read.

For those interested in the AI component, the repository will also contain the necessary code and instructions. This will let you run the RAG system, ask questions, and see how it pulls answers directly from this knowledge base.

------

## What's Next

This is the initial version of the knowledge base and the RAG setup. Here are some plans for future enhancements:

- Expanding the article collection and adding more depth to topics.
- Refining the RAG pipeline to get even better retrieval accuracy and response generation.
- Potentially developing a simple user interface for easier interaction with the RAG system.

 ## How to Run

1. Clone the repo  
2. Install dependencies: Create a virtual environment and install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the notebook `rag_softskills_demo.ipynb`  
4. Run all cells to see the RAG demo in action
